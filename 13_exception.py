#EXCEPTION HANDLING
"""
Many a times though, program results in an error after it is run even if
it doesnâ€™t have any syntax error. Such an error is a runtime error called as exception.
Two keywords -  try and except - perform exception handling.
The try: block contains statements which are susceptible for exception.
If block is executed without exception,
the except: block (which must appear immediately after try block) is SKIPPED.
IF THERE IS NO ERROR IN TRY, THEN EXCEPT PART WILL BE SKIPPED
